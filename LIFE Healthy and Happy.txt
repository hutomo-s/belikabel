1. Regular exercise
Early morning exercise helps your body burns more calories after your workout, even when you’re sitting at a desk or driving in your car.

2. Healthy breakfast
Breakfast is the most crucial meal of the day. Eating breakfast is associated with a lower incidence of heart disease in men between ages 45 and 82 and improved cognitive function related to memory and test grades.

3. Be safety conscious on the road
You probably here this every day, but it's worth repeating -- be aware when you're driving. Never lose concentration.

4. Don’t work under pressure
The best way to enjoy the world of entrepreneurship is to have a stress-free work habit. Workplace stress derives from many sources. It can be annoying employees and long commutes and never-ending workloads. 

5. Rest amidst challenging workloads
Recovery opportunities might range from breaks during the workday, vacations and sleep. 

Subjects who used the time for restorative activities like relaxing, social activities and napping got the benefit, while those who used the time for chores didn't.

Entrepreneurs are wonderful people. Their safety and well-being are critical to the world. That's why you should never risk your health for the sake of your business: If you suffer, your business will suffer, too.
