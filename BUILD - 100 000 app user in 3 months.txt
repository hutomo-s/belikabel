5 things we did to get our app’s first 100,000 users in 3 months

1. Research with a twist
The reason I like to have coffee catch-ups (make sure you pay for the coffee too!) before doing my full internet research is I get to start with a clean slate. I can actually use my two ears to listen and my mouth only to ask more questions. (I learned a few years ago that one of my biggest mistakes as a founder was listening to respond. The right thing to do is to actually listen to understand someone’s point.)

It also gave me confidence that there was a big opportunity for us (not that I did not do comprehensive research after the coffees, of course).

2. Attack a problem

creating something that solved an existing demand.

cheaper and more accessible?

By maximizing our chances of success, I also mitigated the risk of failure.

Sometimes, in a world full of information and updates, keeping things simple is the best way to find clarity and focus.

3. Choose content first

Design is super important. Some of the best apps in the world are so intuitive that they never cease to amaze me. But ours? Not yet. With creating a new project or launching a new product, it is important to have a budget—at least a rough one—to go by.

With this in mind, I chose to invest more heavily in content first rather than splurging on a beautifully designed app with no or low-quality content.

4. Be the face of your product 

I saw that in the Philippines, people follow people and are interested in their stories much more than just a company advertisement.

I’ve learned that someone needs to promote your product, and if you don’t, who will? We found that this worked tremendously and through networking, we got athletes, actors, models, and online stars to endorse us.

5. Double down on what is working

complacency is what kills startups
