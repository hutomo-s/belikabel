6. DON’T BE AFRAID OF TAKING RISK

There will moments in your career when you will be able to pick the easy way of accomplishing your task or trying something experimental. I don’t refer only to technology. You might want to step out of strict rules of your company if you feel this is for the better. In the end of the day, the job you did is the most important.  This might not be the path preferred by everyone. It can be a rocky one, but if you got balls you should try walking it. Some say – no risk, no gain.


8. DON’T BE THE BIGGEST FISH IN THE TANK

(my personal favorite.)
If you decided to get into some development team, try to find one with at least one developer you consider better than yourself. He is the one you are going to learn most from. No matter how experienced you are, this job is about constant development of yourself as well. It’s good to have some mentor of your own.
