     	Sorry, this feature is deprecated

4. Webview
   - use custom route group of webview, for ensuring the cohesive from general web application
		two routes for one page
		eg: /webview/...
   - always use http-header
   		- Authentication (optional)
		- Channel
		- Client-Version
		- Webview: 1
   - always use GET method
